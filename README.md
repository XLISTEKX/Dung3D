## Concept
imagine riven from league of legends, but in a separate game
why riven? - she has some sick combos.
why a separate game? - league of legends provides players with quantity over quality. Since riot games, an indie game development studio, doesn't have the necessary funds to make their games flow nicely and make all the combos feel fluid, we have decided to take matters in our own hands.
In order to make the game fun, we want to incorporate a flow, a very gratifying gameplay style with countless combinations that seamlessly blend with each other and reward the player for their smart upgrade choices and skilful input combinations.
